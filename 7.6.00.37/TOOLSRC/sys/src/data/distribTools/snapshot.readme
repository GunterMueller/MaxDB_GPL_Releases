======

This is a source snapshot of the SAP DB development tools.

Running
./configure && make
will build the SAP DB development tools. After a sucessful build, the
current directory is suitable as $TOOL for a SAP DB build.

If you have the SAP DB sources, ./bin/newSapdbSrc.py will create
a shell script to init the necessary environment variables.

Caveat:
  * 'make install' isn't implemented either
