PREREQUISITES
    Before installing the driver make sure that you have the following
    prerequisites available.

    Perl
        Build, test and install Perl 5 (at least 5.6.1). It is very
        important to TEST it and INSTALL it!

    DBI Build, test and install DBI (at least 1.21). Since DBD::MaxDB is a
        DBI driver, you need DBI. It is available at:

        http://search.cpan.org

    C compiler
        A C compiler is required, since currently you can only install from
        source. Maybe a binary version will be available in future releases.

        Make sure, that the C compiler you use is the same C compiler that
        was used for compiling Perl! Otherwise you will almost definitely
        encounter problems because of differences in the underlying C
        runtime libraries.

    MaxDB SQLDBC-SDK
        The DBD::MaxDB driver needs to link with MaxDB's common database
        interface SQLDBC which is not included in this distribution. You
        need at least the version 7.5.00.12. For details about SQLDBC see:

        http://www.mysql.com/products/maxdb/pdf/sqldbc_eng.pdf

        You can download the SQLDBC software development kit from the MySQL
        homepage at:

        http://www.mysql.com/maxdb

        or from the ftp server at:

        ftp://ftp.sap.com/pub/maxdb/7.5.00

            There are different ways to install the SQLDBC software
            development kit.

        Install using SDBINST
            You need to download and unpack the MaxDB standard installation
            package (maxdb-all-<os>-[32 or
            64]bit-<arch>-<version>_<build>.<tgz>)

            Go to the directory into which you unpacked the installation
            package. Enter the following commands:

              ./SDBINST -package Base
              ./SDBINST -package "Database Connectivity"

            The Base package is required for SQLDBC SDK. If you have already
            installed it, you can skip the first command.

        Install from tarball
            Download the latest version of the SQLDBC SDK from the MySQL
            homepage or the ftp server. Choose the SQLDBC package that
            matches your operating system architecture.

            Unpack the tarball to a local directory of your choice with the
            following command:

             tar xvzf maxdb-all-<os>-32|64bit-<arch>-<version>_<build>

    MaxDB database server
        Of course you will need a MaxDB database instance. The DBD::MaxDB
        driver supports all available versions of MaxDB (SAP DB) at least
        7.3. The MaxDB software and documentation can be found at:

        http://www.mysql.com/maxdb

INSTALLATION
    By default Makefile.PL uses the MaxDB global configuration file
    (/etc/opt/sdb) on Unix/Linux platforms or the registry (requires
    Win32API::Registry) on Windows platforms for retrieving the location of
    "SQLDBC-SDK".

    If the location of "SQLDBC-SDK" cannot be found or if you want to
    control it yourself, define the environment variables "SQLDBCSDK" or set
    the option "-o <path>" when calling " perl Makefile.PL "

    Since the tests will connect to a live database, you need to set the
    following environment variables for the tests to run:

      DBI_DSN=dbi:MaxDB:<host>/<dbname>
      DBI_USER=<username>
      DBI_PASS=<password>
  
    E.g. Definition of the parameter url for a connection to the database
    TST on the computer REMOTESERVER " dbi:MaxDB:REMOTESERVER/TST "

    Now you are ready, to make and install DBD::MaxDB. The final steps are:

      1.   perl Makefile.PL
      2.   make              (or nmake, if VC++ on windows)
      3.   make test         (or nmake, if VC++ on windows)
      4.   make install      (or nmake, if VC++ on windows)

    Note that you should execute steps 1 to 3 as a normal user, not as root!

TESTING
    You need to set the following environment variables for the tests to
    run:

      DBI_DSN=dbi:MaxDB:<host>/<dbname>
      DBI_USER=<username>
      DBI_PASS=<password>

    Execute the command:

    "make test" or "make test TEST_VERBOSE=1"

    to run the test suite. Running the test suite should not show any
    errors.

    Since DBD::MaxDB uses the shared library "libSQLDBC_C.so"
    ("libSQLDBC_C.dll" on windows), you have to ensure that this library can
    be found by the operating system. On windows you should add the
    "libSQLDBC_C.dll" to you "PATH" environment variable. On Unix/Linux you
    will normally add the path of "libSQLDBC_C.[so|sl]" to the environment
    variable "LD_LIBRARY_PATH".
