			XML::Parser Version 2.29

This is a Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat.
It requires at least version 5.004 of perl. The documentation for this
extension can be found in pod format at the end of the files Parser.pm
and Expat/Expat.pm. The perldoc program, provided with the perl distribution,
can be used to view this documentation.

The necessary parts of the expat library are included in this distribution in
the directory Expat/expat. These components are copyrighted by James Clark,
with patches copyrighted by Clark Cooper. They are licensed under your choice
of either the Mozilla Public License version 1.1 (MPL) or the GNU Public
License (GPL).

This was modified from the original XML::Parser created by Larry Wall.

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install XML::Parser somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl INSTALLDIRS=perl

Then to build you run make.

	make

You can then test the module by typing:

	make test

There are some sample utilities in the samples directory along with an
xml form of the XML specification to test them on. You may need to change
the '#!' line at the top of these utilities to what is appropriate for
your system. If you're going to play around with them prior to installing
the module, you would need to add the blib paths to your perl search
path, like this (assuming your current directory is samples):

    perl -I../blib/lib -I../blib/arch xmlcomments REC-xml-19980210.xml

or set your PERLLIB environment variable.

If you have write access to the installation directories, you may then
install by typing:

	make install

Discussion on features and bugs of this software and general discussion
on topics relating to perl and XML takes place on the perl-xml mailing
list, to which you can subscribe by sending mail to:

Differences from Version 2.28
=============================

The default LWP external entity handler is now dynamicly loaded on the
first call to the default external entity handler. Also there is a
NoLWP option to XML::Parser that forces use of the file based external
entity handler (unless the application supplies an external entity handler.)

The LWP external entity handler now recognizes proxy evironment variables
as described the LWP documentation on the env_proxy method.

It's now possible to use the ExpatNB object directly, since the protective
_State_ attribute is set in the parse_more method.

Fixed the ERRSV bug that was causing problems for users of perl 5.004.

Fixed bug in XML::Parser::new that overrode application supplied external
entity handlers.

Fixed bugs in expat that caused notation declarations and attlist declarations
with notation types to be ignored.

Changed the canonical script to take a filename argument (in order to get
base path information.)
