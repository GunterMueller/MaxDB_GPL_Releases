This module is built on top of the expat C library written by
James Clark <jjc@jclark.com>. The expat distribution is contained
in the expat sub-directory. You may find out the version by reading
expat/expat.html.

The material in the expat directory is covered by your choice of the
Mozilla Public License version 1.1(MPL) or Gnu Public License (GPL).

If the file expat.patches in this sub-directory is non-empty, then I
have made local patches to this library. The expat.patches file will
contain the differences from the original (of the version referred to
in expat/expat.html) to my patched version. Using the patch facility,
you could get to my patched version from James Clark's original by applying
expat.patches to it.

If you are going to use this patched version of expat outside of XML::Parser,
then you should refer to it as perl-expat, with a version number corresponding
to that of the distribution of XML::Parser that you obtained it from.
