#                       How to make 'PTOC' completely anew, provided
#                       some older version exists
#

# Tell everybody where we are
PTOCROOT=`pwd`          export PTOCROOT

mv make.prot make.pold
echo ===== MAKEALL `date` > make.prot

# Remove anything left from any previous experiment
echo ----- make clean >> make.prot
make clean | tee -a make.prot

# Now, make the tools needed to bootstrap this version and the runtime lib
echo ----- make mktools >> make.prot
make mktools | tee -a make.prot
echo ----- make libs >> make.prot
make libs | tee -a make.prot

# Now the last step
echo ----- make csys >> make.prot
make csys | tee -a make.prot
