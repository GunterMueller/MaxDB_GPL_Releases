Usage : ptoc [option] filename.p
____________________________________________________________________________

*** ptoc is NOT a compiler. It runs only as a transpiler, that translates
    Pascal-files to C-files.

*** ptoc [option] can be any option you know from CLE-compiler which
    support the preprocessor or frontend-code-generation.
    There are two additional options :
    -Xx (static link option) for nested procedures
    -Xc forces constants to be replaced by their values

*** To compile and execute your modules, you have to use the standard C-
    Compiler in addition with /usr/lib/libsqlptc.a .

*** E.g.:        ptoc -qn test.p
		 cc -o test test.c -lsqlptc
