1.      Extract the include modules:

	mfpinc vsp00    # creates vsp00.con vsp00.typ
	mfcinc ven00c   # creates ven00c.h

2.      Extract the modules:

	mfp ven01 vsp00.con vsp00.typ ven00.con ven00.typ  # creates ven01.p
	mfc ven03c vsp00c.h ven00c.h                       # creates ven03c.c

	The order of the include files is important.
	This is a list of includes needed by modules:

	vsp*    need    vsp00
	ven     need    vsp00 ven00
	vpc     need    vsp00 vpc00

	modules ending with 'c' or 'a' are C or assembler modules
	respectively. C modules need C includes instead of pascal includes.

3.      Some shell scripts "mfp", "mfc", ... are delivered in
	several versions (.t35, .pws, .ack). So the most appropriate
	version can be selected and adapted.

4.      Some PASCAL compilers have problems with string lengths.
	In some modules several string length problems arise in
	conjunction with few variables. In those cases it is very
	convenient to use the tool "mfstrlen":

	mfstrlen ven01 ven01.new diag_msg 60
