Environment usage:

    SHELL           Pathname for shell to use for commands

    TOOLSHELL       Pathname for shell to use for tools

    TOOLEXT         file extension for shell to use for tool (e.g. .pl)

    TOOLOPT         options to use with $TOOLSHELL

    DBROOT          Root directory for distributable files

    VMAKE_PATH      Root directory search list
		      VMAKE_PATH=<local_root>[,<root_spec>...]
		      <root_spec>=[node:]directory[//]
		      //: Don't use objects from this path
		    Examples:
		      VMAKE_PATH=/u/rel30,sqlkern:/u/rel30,sqlall1:/u/rel301k
		      VMAKE_PATH=/u/rel30,sqldia2:/u/rel30//,sqldial:/u/rel30//

    VMAKE_VERSION   Optional module version

    VMAKE_DEFAULT   Optional default module version

    VMAKE_OPTION    Option characters that modify default behaviour:

		i   Include files are included in dependency rules
		I   i + sizeof is run when include is rebuilt

		s   Use source files (module frame), if present
		S   Source files must be present

		p   Maintain PASCAL-Level files, if present
		P   Create/Use PASCAL-Level files

		c   Maintain C-Level files, if present
		C   Create/Use C-Level-files

		o   Create objects but don't build relocs or programs
		O   Create objects and build libs, relocs, programs

		h   Give '.shm' precedence over '.lnk'
		t   Timestamp the start of bigger targets (lib,rel,pgm,mac)
		T   Timestamp the start of all targets

		Source file search options:

		-   (none) Use the source file found first
		v   Warn about newer sources on later trees
		V   Copy newer sources from later trees
		vV  Warn and copy newer sources from later trees

		Object file search options:

		-   (none) Use the object file found first
		w   Warn about newer objects on later trees
		W   Copy newer objects from later trees
		wW  Warn and copy newer objects from later trees

		M   All modules are to be built as independent objects
		L   Libraries are to be treated like relocatables
		    (contents is of no meaning, library date is significant,
		     old library is always completely rebuilt from objects)

		l   Local make: use local objects until local source newer
		g   Global make: create current targets

		D   Use dates files

		R   ignore shrglob/noshrglob descriptions
		A   Allow for object copy on local host
		b   Allow C modules to include Pascal includes
		H   Don't create/use C headers from P sources
		Z   accept old resource format
		X   Use Sources from CDROM (set write permissions)
		a   only warning if filename not case sensitive 

Target options:

    Specify as:         <target><delimiter><option>[<delimiter><option>...]
    Delimiters:         blanks,tabs,slashes
			(NOTE: blanks and tabs must be escaped from shell)
    Example:            vak77/q/debug/p

    f                   make this target in fast version
    q                   make this target in quick version
    s                   make this target in slow version
    ff                  version fast, default fast
    ...                 ... and other combinations ...
    ss                  version slow, default slow

    d | debug           include debugger information into this target
    p | profile         include profiling calls into this target
	distrib             target included in the distrib list
    shrglob		target contains global variables in shared memory
    noshrglob		disables 'shrglob'
    opt=<option chars>  vmake option characters (see VMAKE_OPTION above)
    inc=[module,...]    include list (+module adds, -module excludes)
    trace=<procedure>   trace procedure
    check=[no|yes]      procedure name prefix check
    <name>[=<value>]    conditional compilation symbol
    -<name>[=<value>]   compiler option
