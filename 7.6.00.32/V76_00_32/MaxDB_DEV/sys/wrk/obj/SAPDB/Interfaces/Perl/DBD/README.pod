=head1 IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:

This module is maintained and supported on a mailing list,

F<maxdb@lists.mysql.com>

Please send comments and bug-reports to this list. Please include the output of
perl -v [-V], the version of the MaxDB database, the version of the MaxDB
SQLDBC-SDK, the version of DBI, and details about your platform in your bug report.

Mailing list archives are available at:

L<http://lists.mysql.com/maxdb>

Additionally you might try the dbi-user mailing list for questions about
DBI and its modules in general.

=head1 PREREQUISITES

Before installing the driver make sure that you have the following prerequisites
available.

=over

=item Perl

Build, test and install Perl 5 (at least 5.6.1). It is very important to TEST it
and INSTALL it!

=item DBI

Build, test and install DBI (at least 1.21). Since DBD::MaxDB is a DBI driver,
you need DBI. It is available at:

L<http://search.cpan.org>

=item C compiler

A C compiler is required, since currently you can only install from source. Maybe
a binary version will be available in future releases.

Make sure, that the C compiler you use is the same C compiler that was used
for compiling Perl! Otherwise you will almost definitely encounter problems
because of differences in the underlying C runtime libraries.

=item MaxDB SQLDBC-SDK

The DBD::MaxDB driver needs to link with MaxDB's common database interface
SQLDBC which is not included in this distribution. You need at least the
version 7.6.00.19. But you should use a newer version of SQLDBC from release
7.6.00. For details about SQLDBC see:

L<http://www.mysql.com/products/maxdb/pdf/sqldbc_eng.pdf>

You can download the SQLDBC software development kit from the MySQL homepage at:

L<http://www.mysql.com/maxdb>

=over

There are different ways to install the SQLDBC software development kit.

=item Install using SDBINST

You need to download and unpack the MaxDB standard installation package
F<(maxdb-all-E<lt>osE<gt>-[32 or 64]bit-E<lt>archE<gt>-E<lt>versionE<gt>_E<lt>buildE<gt>.E<lt>tgzE<gt>)>

Go to the directory into which you unpacked the installation package. Enter the
following commands:

  ./SDBINST -package Base
  ./SDBINST -package "Database Connectivity"

The Base package is required for SQLDBC SDK. If you have already installed it,
you can skip the first command.

=item Install from tarball

Download the latest version of the SQLDBC SDK from the MySQL homepage or the ftp
server. Choose the SQLDBC package that matches your operating system architecture.

Unpack the tarball to a local directory of your choice with the following command:

 tar xvzf maxdb-all-<os>-32|64bit-<arch>-<version>_<build>

=item MaxDB database server

Of course you will need a MaxDB database instance. The DBD::MaxDB driver supports
all available versions of MaxDB (SAP DB) at least 7.3. The MaxDB software and
documentation can be found at:

L<http://www.mysql.com/maxdb>

=head1 INSTALLATION

By default Makefile.PL uses the MaxDB global configuration file (S</etc/opt/sdb>)
on Unix/Linux platforms or the registry (requires S<Win32API::Registry>) on Windows
platforms for retrieving the location of C<SQLDBC-SDK>.

If the location of C<SQLDBC-SDK> cannot be found or if you want to
control it yourself, define the environment variables C<SQLDBCSDK>
or set the option C<< -o <path> >> when calling C< perl Makefile.PL >

Since the tests will connect to a live database, you need to set the
following environment variables for the tests to run:

  DBI_DSN=dbi:MaxDB:<host>/<dbname>
  DBI_USER=<username>
  DBI_PASS=<password>
  
E.g. Definition of the parameter url for a connection to the database TST on 
the computer REMOTESERVER C< dbi:MaxDB:REMOTESERVER/TST >

Now you are ready, to make and install DBD::MaxDB. The final steps are:

  1.   perl Makefile.PL
  2.   make              (or nmake, if VC++ on windows)
  3.   make test         (or nmake, if VC++ on windows)
  4.   make install      (or nmake, if VC++ on windows)

Note that you should execute steps 1 to 3 as a normal user, not as root!

=head1 TESTING

You need to set the following environment variables for the tests to run:

  DBI_DSN=dbi:MaxDB:<host>/<dbname>
  DBI_USER=<username>
  DBI_PASS=<password>

Execute the command:

C<make test> or C<make test TEST_VERBOSE=1>

to run the test suite. Running the test suite should not show any errors.

Since DBD::MaxDB uses the shared library C<libSQLDBC_C.so> (C<libSQLDBC_C.dll>
on windows), you have to ensure that this library can be found by the operating
system. On windows you should add the C<libSQLDBC_C.dll> to you C<PATH>
environment variable. On Unix/Linux you will normally add the path of
C<libSQLDBC_C.[so|sl]> to the environment variable C<LD_LIBRARY_PATH>.
